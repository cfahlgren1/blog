Today researchers finally patched a buffer overflow vulnerability through the long "Title name" field in the "mail box" data which is mishandled in an "Open from mail box" action

An attacker would be able to exploit this buffer overflow vulnerability ([CVE-2017-17946](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17946)) by opening a malicious database file through the "open from mail box" action which would enable execution from arbitrary code remotely.

Buffer Overflows happen when developers forget to add bound checking and input data checking and instead trust input data insecurely. Common exploits for buffer overflows are done by shellcoding which can cause remote code execution.


The vulnerability is in Handy Password 4.9.3 and has since been patched.
