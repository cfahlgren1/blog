On January 8th, the Wifi-Alliance introduced new security improvements and standards for the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA3).
<!--more-->

## What is WPA?

WPA and WPA2 were encryption standards that replaced the insecure WEP protocol.

**WPA Features**

* Stronger Authentication
* Longer Cipher Keys
* Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
* Cryptographic Checksum

WPA2 further enhanced the WPA protocol by adding the Cipher Block Chaining Message Protocol that is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption. CCMP was seen to be much more secure than TKIP, but also required the replacement of many Acess Points(AP).

However, WPA2 has fallen short due to the unencrypted "open" Wi-Fi networks. With WPA2, an attack can sit on the network and sniff passwords and other data if the client isn't using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Additionally, WPA2 is vulnerable to a vulnerability called Key Reinstallation Attack (KRACK) which allows hackers to decrypt Wi-Fi communications. KRACK is an attack which tricks a user into reinstalling the key and switching to an insecure network allowing the attacker to sniff data.

[WPA3](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-security-enhancements) is the new standard that has been unveiled this new year which includes four new capabilities for both Personal and Enterprise networks.

**WPA3 will include**

* Protections for insecure passwords
* Easier configuration of security for devices with minimal display interface
* A 192 bit security suite built with the Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite
* Individualized Data Protection

“Wi-Fi security technologies may live for decades, so it’s important they are continually updated to ensure they meet the needs of the Wi-Fi industry,” said Joe Hoffman, SAR Insight & Consulting. “Wi-Fi is evolving to maintain its high-level of security as industry demands increase.”

Although these new security standards are exciting, it could be weeks, maybe months before manufacturers start to offer the WPA3 standard.
