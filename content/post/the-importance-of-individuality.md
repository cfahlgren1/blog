Here is a small list of important things I learned as I left high school and entering college.

<!--more-->

1. **Develop relationships based on companionship and investment in each other rather on mutual interests/hobbies.** (Multi-Dimensional relationships vs surface level)!
2. **Don't be afraid to have deep, meaningful life discussions!** (you will learn alot)!
3. **BE YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL AND EMBRACE YOUR UNIQUENESS!** (wear whatever you'd like, do things that aren't always regarded as normal or popular)
4. **Don't establish your identity in sports, school, or hobbies!**
5. **Don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in!** (even if your friends or family doesn't agree)
6. **Don't spend all your time in school!** (balance your life and do things you enjoy while also making life long friends)
7. **Know your own self worth!** (it doesn't matter what other people think. live is supposed to be fun, not full of thinking what others might think of you)
8. **Don't hold grudges!** (life is too short for that and it only fosters negativity)
9. **Don't have any regrets!** (everything can be a life lesson to learn from)
