On December 31st, 2017, starting the new year on a great foot, a new Mac exploit has been released.

See tweet below
On [twitter](https://twitter.com/s1guza/status/947603265700601856), security researcher going by the name "siguza" released the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Siguza/IOHIDeous) and [writeup](https://t.co/oG2nOlUOjk) containing the exploit.

According to Siguza, this vulnerability has been around since 2002 or even earlier. 

This bug targets a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability which enables a basic user to have root access on the system where malicious code could be executed.

This bug is part of the - IOHIDFamily - that can enable a hacker to run a root shell. Siguza notes that this vulnerability affects all versions of macOSX and enables write priveledges to the kernel. 

Additionally, this exploit can disable the [System Integrity Protection (SIP)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) and the Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI), which are both security features designed to prevent malware.

## Will this bug affect me?

Siguza notes that the bug cannot be exploited remoteley by saying, 

**“[The bug] needs to be running on the host already (nothing remote), achieves full system compromise by itself, but logs you out in the process”**

Many wonder why Siguza did not contact Apple or sell it.

One Twitter user asked just this!

Can I ask, why not sell it? I'm sure some government or blackhat would have paid a lot for it? Or are you just the type of person who can't be reasoned with, who doesn't care for money and just want to watch the world burn?

Siguza replied by saying,

My primary goal was to get the write-up out for people to read. I wouldn't sell to blackhats because I don't wanna help their cause. I would've submitted to Apple if their bug bounty included macOS, or if the vuln was remotely exploitable.

Since Apple does not include Mac OS in its Bug Bounty, Siguza decided to just release it since it wasn't remote or extremely critical.
