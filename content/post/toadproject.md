In this post, I would like to share my idea for a potential project that I would like to develop. I'm calling it TOAD (The Open Access Directory).
<!--more-->

## What is TOAD?

The aim for The Open Access Directory is to create a central hub of information where users can search, view, and download documents, writeups, whitepapers, books, and
any other document based information.

Currently, knowledge and publications are spread out all over the internet. Some providers like JSTOR are able to deliver information on scientific research or other lab work.
Others may provide engineering papers, cryptocurrency whitepapers, law and court documents, or maybe even pdfs of books.

The Open Access Directory, would consolodate all of this information into one website where anyone can freely be able to access information and publications. My goal is for
TOAD to be a place where people can submit documents or publications that they have worked on and be able to share that with the world.

Information in 2018 should be easily accessible and free. We shouldn't be paying companies to have access to basic information which should be a human right.

Finally, I want TOAD to be transparent. This is why I plan to make TOAD open source when it is fully developed.

With TOAD, I want to extend the legacy of the late Aaron Swartz and create an environment where researchers, scholars, and everyday people can learn, access, and publish information.

## How would you fund TOAD and pay for server costs?

The Toad Project would hopefully gain funding through optional donations from users and crowdfunding fundraisers. The goal of TOAD is NOT to earn profit by limiting our users.

## What can I do to help TOAD become a reality?

Well, currently, I am looking for someone who would be willing to co-develop this project. If you have strong web development skills, specifically in Django,
database (Mongo DB), and scalability (Google Cloud, AWS) then please email me at x0ex\[at\]x0ex\[.\]com.

# Edit

I have found that the website, archive.org satisfies the need for an open directory similar to above and have decided to no longer pursue this project.
