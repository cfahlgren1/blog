Recently, in my IT Security Class, the topic of open source software has come up multiple times. To my disappointment I find that many are confused about what open source software (OSS) is and why it's important.
<!--more-->

To start off, I would like to debunk multiple misconseptions about OSS before I talk about its importance.

## 1. Open Source Software is more vulnerable to attacks since everyone can view the code

This is a common misconception as many think that since the code is viewable to everyone it is less secure. However, this is quite the opposite.
Linus' Law can be summarized to say,

**Many eyes make secure code**

Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, believes that with enough "eyes" and a large developer base, that
bugs can be quickly characterized and fixed and I truly agree with this. This is why you might notice that Linux is known to be one of the most security focused operating systems.

**When literally anyone can look at your source code, it ensures that you are:**

* Implementing standards and protocols correctly
* Writing secure code
* Not sending data where you aren't supposed to (Microsoft)

If there is a vulnerability in open source software, it usually is quickly fixed and found as transparency and collaboration of code is the main goal.
With projects that are closed source, you might have a handful of developers looking at it and testing it, where an open source community might contain
hundreds of developers devoted to the project.

## 2. Open Source Software is High Quality

One pro of open source software is that anyone can contribute. However, this does not mean that anyone can make any change to the software they wish.

Code changes and edits have to be verified by members of the open source project who "verify" that the code is written correctly, formatted appropriately, and provides correct documentation. These senior members
are some of the best programmers in the world working on huge projects such as Bitcoin.

## 3. Open Source Projects are working for free

Essentially, this might seem the case at first, but many projects have found other revenues of income.

**For example, to earn revenue to develop your open source project you might:**

* Sell apparel based on your product
* Sell training software
* Sell Books
* Sell Support
* Apply for donations and grants

The Perl language, an open source project, pays its developers through these revenue streams.

## Why is open source software important

Now that we have gotten past the 3 common open source software misconceptions, we can talk about why open source is important.

Open Source is imporant as we need to establish trust and transparency between developers, companies, and the end users. The end users should not be in the dark on how
their software truly works behind the scene.

Open Source will open up ideas and innovation to anyone willing to learn. Developers and leaders would be able to implement other programs and software into their code and
learn from other projects.

We shouldn't be restricting the flow of knowledge, community, and transparency by greedily hiding the source code from users.

Although, I might have bashed on Microsoft earlier, I do condone their effort to make some programs open source such as Powershell and other programs that have become open source.
However, I would like to see these companies be more transparent on what the underlying functions of the operating systems and programs are doing and how they work.
